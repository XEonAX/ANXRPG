# ANXRPG Development Changelog

## Version 0.3.0 - Status Effects System Release (October 21, 2025)

### ✅ Phase 5: Status Effects System (COMPLETE)
**Status**: Fully implemented and tested

#### Implementation Details
- Created comprehensive status effect manager with application, tracking, and removal
- Implemented effect types: buffs, debuffs, DOT, HOT, and control effects
- Built turn-based duration tracking with expiration handling
- Integrated stacking behavior (stackable vs non-stackable effects)
- Implemented per-turn effect processing (tick system)
- Applied status effect stat modifiers to character stats

#### Status Effect Manager (`systems/statusEffects.ts`)
**Core Functions**:
- `applyStatusEffect()` - Apply effects with stacking and duration refresh logic
- `removeStatusEffect()` - Remove specific effects from characters
- `processStatusEffectTicks()` - Handle DOT/HOT damage and healing per turn
- `decrementStatusEffectDurations()` - Countdown durations and expire effects
- `calculateStatusEffectStatModifiers()` - Calculate flat and multiplicative stat changes
- `isUnderControlEffect()` - Check for stun/freeze/sleep effects
- `hasStatusEffect()`, `getStatusEffect()` - Effect query utilities
- `reduceEffectStacks()` - Stack management for stackable effects

**Features**:
- **Stacking System**: Stackable effects accumulate (up to max stacks), non-stackable refresh duration
- **Duration Tracking**: Turn-based countdown with automatic expiration
- **Tick Timing**: Effects can tick at turn start or turn end
- **Stat Modifiers**: Both flat bonuses (+20 ATK) and multipliers (×1.25 ATK)
- **DOT/HOT**: Damage/healing per turn with stacking support
- **Control Effects**: Prevent actions (stun, freeze, sleep, petrify)

#### Predefined Status Effects (`data/statusEffects.ts`)
**Buffs** (8 types):
- Attack Up, Defense Up, Magic Up, Resistance Up
- Haste (speed), Critical Up, Evasion Up, Accuracy Up

**Debuffs** (5 types):
- Attack Down, Defense Down, Magic Down, Resistance Down, Slow

**DOT Effects** (4 types):
- Poison (4 turns, 10 dmg/turn, 5 max stacks)
- Burn (3 turns, 15 dmg/turn, 3 max stacks)
- Bleed (5 turns, 8 dmg/turn, 5 max stacks)
- Curse (6 turns, 12 dmg/turn, non-stackable)

**HOT Effects** (2 types):
- Regeneration (5 turns, 20 heal/turn, 3 max stacks)
- Blessed (4 turns, 25 heal/turn, non-stackable)

**Control Effects** (4 types):
- Stunned (1 turn, prevents actions)
- Frozen (2 turns, prevents actions)
- Sleep (3 turns, breaks on damage)
- Petrified (2 turns, +50 DEF +100% DEF multiplier)

**Special Effects** (3 types):
- Bloodlust (+50% ATK, +20% CRT, -30% DEF)
- Berserk (+100% ATK, -50% DEF)
- Divine Blessing (+20% all stats, +15 heal/turn)

#### Character Integration
- Updated `calculateCurrentStats()` to apply status effect stat modifiers
- Updated `regenerateAp()` to include AP regen modifiers from effects
- Stat modifiers apply after equipment bonuses
- Flat modifiers apply first, then multipliers
- Stats capped at reasonable min/max values (CRT 0-100%, EVA 0-95%, ACC 5-100%)

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
// Apply a buff
applyStatusEffect(character, ATTACK_BUFF);
// character.stats.atk now +20 and ×1.25

// Stack poison
applyStatusEffect(character, POISON); // 10 dmg/turn
applyStatusEffect(character, POISON); // 20 dmg/turn (2 stacks)

// Process turn effects
const { damage, healing } = processStatusEffectTicks(character, true);
// Applies DOT damage and HOT healing

// Decrement and expire
decrementStatusEffectDurations(character);
// Removes effects with duration <= 0
```

## Development Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Type Safety First**: Strict TypeScript mode ensures compile-time error catching
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between types, systems, data, and UI
3. **Formula Transparency**: All game formulas centralized in `utils/formulas.ts`
4. **Ability Balance**: AP costs scale with power level, unlock progression at levels 1/5/10/20
5. **Character Diversity**: Each type has distinct role, stat distribution, and AP regen rate
6. **Equipment Scaling**: Dynamic stat scaling ensures equipment remains relevant at all levels
7. **Status Effects**: Flexible system supports stacking, DOT/HOT, and control effects
8. **Stat Modifiers**: Flat bonuses and multiplicative modifiers for deep customization

### Technical Highlights
- Pure TypeScript with no frameworks (as per design requirements)
- Semantic HTML structure ready for UI implementation
- Comprehensive type system enables autocomplete and type checking
- Modular architecture allows independent system development
- Formula-based calculations ensure consistency

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing via browser console
- Type checking with `npm run type-check`
- Build validation with `npm run build`
- Visual testing in development server
