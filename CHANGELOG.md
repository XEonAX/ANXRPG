### ✅ Phase 2: Character System (COMPLETE)
**Status**: Fully implemented and tested

#### Implementation Details
- Defined all 6 character types with balanced stats:
  - **Alpha (Paladin)**: 120 HP, +3 AP/turn - Tank/Off-Healer
  - **Beta (Rogue)**: 70 HP, +6 AP/turn - Critical DPS
  - **Gamma (Mage)**: 60 HP, +4 AP/turn - AoE/Elemental Caster
  - **Delta (Warrior)**: 100 HP, +4 AP/turn - Physical DPS
  - **Epsilon (Cleric)**: 80 HP, +5 AP/turn - Healer/Support
  - **Zeta (Berserker)**: 90 HP, +5 AP/turn - High Risk/Reward

- Implemented character management system:
  - `createCharacter()` - Factory function for character creation
  - `calculateStatsAtLevel()` - Stat scaling with level
  - `regenerateAp()` - AP regeneration per turn
  - `consumeAp()` / `restoreAp()` - AP management
  - `damageCharacter()` / `healCharacter()` - HP management
  - `awardXp()` - XP and level-up system
  - `canUseAbility()` - Ability usage validation

- Created formula utilities:
  - `calculateXpForLevel()` - Exponential XP curve (100 * level^2.5)
  - `calculatePhysicalDamage()` - (ATK * mult) - (DEF * 0.5)
  - `calculateMagicalDamage()` - (MAG * mult) - (RES * 0.5)
  - `calculateHitChance()` - ACC vs EVA formula
  - `applyCriticalMultiplier()` - 2x damage on crit
  - `calculateEnemyStatScaling()` - Enemy scaling formula

- Created RNG utilities for consistent randomness

**Files Created**: 4 files, ~600 lines of TypeScript

## Development Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Type Safety First**: Strict TypeScript mode ensures compile-time error catching
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between types, systems, data, and UI
3. **Formula Transparency**: All game formulas centralized in `utils/formulas.ts`
4. **Ability Balance**: AP costs scale with power level, unlock progression at levels 1/5/10/20
5. **Character Diversity**: Each type has distinct role, stat distribution, and AP regen rate

### Technical Highlights
- Pure TypeScript with no frameworks (as per design requirements)
- Semantic HTML structure ready for UI implementation
- Comprehensive type system enables autocomplete and type checking
- Modular architecture allows independent system development
- Formula-based calculations ensure consistency

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing via browser console
- Type checking with `npm run type-check`
- Build validation with `npm run build`
- Visual testing in development server
