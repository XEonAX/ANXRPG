  - **Reorder characters** within Active/Reserve teams (set turn order!)
  - **Swap between teams** by dragging Active ↔ Reserve
  - **Assign unassigned** characters from roster to teams
  - **Drop on character**: Swap positions or reorder
  - **Drop on empty slot**: Assign to that position
  - **Visual feedback**: 
    - Dragging card becomes semi-transparent (40% opacity)
    - Drop zones glow blue with pulse animation
    - Compact drag preview (name + type + level)
  - **Smart detection**: Characters in roster detected as assigned/unassigned
  - **CSS**: Added `.dragging`, `.drop-target`, `@keyframes pulse-drop-zone`

- ✅ **Team Assignment Buttons** - Fallback for non-drag users
  - Unassigned characters show "To Active" / "To Reserve" buttons
  - Validation for full teams
  - Success notifications on assignment

### Changed
- ✅ **Team Management Enhanced** - Better character organization
  - Character order preserved in Active/Reserve teams
  - Roster section shows all 6 characters (including assigned ones)
  - Visual distinction between assigned/unassigned roster characters
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/ui/TeamManagementScreen.ts`: +185 lines for drag-drop
    - `src/style.css`: +45 lines for drag states

- ✅ **Battle Results Integration** - Recruitment check after victories
  - Checks if player can recruit after victory
  - Redirects to recruitment screen when eligible
  - Passes context (milestone, return stage) for seamless flow
  - **File Modified**: `src/ui/BattleResultsScreen.ts`

- ✅ **Screen Manager** - Added recruitment to navigation
  - New screen type: `'recruitment'`
  - Registered `renderRecruitment` in main.ts
  - Full navigation support

### Fixed
- ✅ **Team Wipe Dialog Duplicates** - Multiple dialogs stacking at bottom

  - Changed to proper modal structure with overlay wrapper
  - Now centers properly on screen with backdrop
  - Only shows once per team wipe
  - **File Modified**: `src/ui/CombatScreen.ts`

- ✅ **Reserve Character Count** - Incorrect count in team wipe dialog

  - Proper pluralization (character vs characters)

- ✅ **Drag-from-Roster Duplication** - Characters duplicating when dragged
  - Issue: Roster shows all characters (including assigned ones)
  - Dragging assigned characters was treating them as "unassigned"
  - **Solution**: Check if character already assigned to a team
  - If assigned: Treat as move between teams (remove from old, add to new)
  - If unassigned: Add to team (original behavior)
  - No more duplication!

- ✅ **Combat Stuck on "Unable to Act"** - Characters frozen at battle start
  - Issue: Status effects from previous battles persisting

## Version 1.2.2 - Feature: Auto-Healing Between Battles (October 22, 2025) - 🏥 HEALING

### Added
- ✅ **Auto-Healing After Victory** - All characters fully restored between battles
  - **What**: After winning a battle, all 6 characters (active + reserve) get full HP and AP restored
  - **When**: Happens when clicking "Continue" on Battle Results screen
  - **Why**: Prevents death spiral, makes game more player-friendly, focuses strategy on individual battles
  - **Function**: Uses `fullyRestoreCharacter()` to restore HP to maxHp, AP to maxAp, and revive dead characters
  - **Notification**: Updated to "Party fully healed! Progress saved!"

### Changed
- Battle Results screen now heals entire roster after victory
- No healing after defeat (return with damaged team)

### Design Decision
- **Full restore** (100% HP/AP) chosen over partial restore
- **Rationale**: Player-friendly, faster gameplay, consistent with genre conventions
- **Alternative considered**: 50% restore (rejected - adds tedium)

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Much more forgiving, encourages experimentation
- **Strategic**: In-combat decisions still critical, but no attrition between battles
- **Difficulty**: Challenge per-battle, not resource management across campaign

### Files Modified
- `src/ui/BattleResultsScreen.ts` - Added healing after victory

### Documentation
- Created `docs/FEATURE_AUTO_HEAL_BETWEEN_BATTLES.md` - Full implementation details

## Version 1.2.1 - Bug Fix: Inventory Back Button (October 22, 2025) - 🐛 FIX

### Fixed
- ✅ **Inventory Back Button Error** - Fixed crash when clicking "Back" from Inventory
  - **Problem**: `goBack()` was navigating with empty context, losing `uiState`
  - **Solution**: Preserve `this.context` when navigating back
  - **File**: `src/ui/core/ScreenManager.ts` line 78
  - **Impact**: Can now navigate back from Inventory to Team Management or Character Sheet without errors

### Technical
- Changed `goBack()` to preserve current context instead of passing empty object
- Navigation flow: Screen A → Inventory (with context) → Back to Screen A (with same context)

---

## Version 1.1.0 - Combat Screen Complete + Critical Bug Fixes (October 22, 2025) - ✅ GAME IS PLAYABLE!

### ✅ Phase 11 Progress: UI Implementation - 80% COMPLETE (8/10 screens)
**Status**: Combat is fully playable! All critical bugs fixed, enemies attack correctly.

**What's New This Session**:
- ✅ **Combat Screen Complete** (660 lines) - Turn-based combat with full enemy AI
- ✅ **Enemy AI Working** - Enemies now attack on their turns!
- ✅ **Click-to-Target System** - Select specific enemies with green glow animations
- ✅ **Critical Bug Fixes** - 5 major bugs fixed, 1 enhancement added
- ✅ **Battle Results Screen** - Victory/defeat with XP, loot, level-ups (197 lines)
- ✅ **Character Sheet Screen** - Stats, equipment, skill tree UI (450 lines + 330 CSS)

**Critical Bug Fixes** (Evening Session - Oct 22, 2025):

1. ✅ **Stage Display Bug** - Fixed "[object Object]" in combat header
   - **Problem**: Passing entire Stage object instead of extracting properties
   - **Fix**: Extract `stageNumber` and `name` from Stage object
   - **File**: `src/ui/CombatScreen.ts` lines 52-56

2. ✅ **Auto-Victory Bug** - Battle didn't end when all enemies defeated
   - **Problem**: Victory check only in `endTurn()`, not after ability execution
   - **Fix**: Added `checkBattleEnd()` after `executeAbility()`
   - **Files**: `src/systems/combat.ts` line 618, `src/ui/CombatScreen.ts` line 540

3. ✅ **Enemy AP Regeneration Crash** - TypeError on enemy turns
   - **Problem**: `regenerateAp()` expects Character type, tries to access CHARACTER_TYPES
   - **Fix**: Split AP regen logic - Characters use `regenerateAp()`, Enemies fetch template
   - **File**: `src/systems/combat.ts` lines 198-217

4. ✅ **Enemy Turn Skipping** - **CRITICAL FIX** - Enemies never attacked!
   - **Problem A**: UI auto-calling `processEnemyTurn()` created cascade of `endTurn()` calls
   - **Problem B**: `getAbility()` only looked up player abilities, returned `undefined` for enemy abilities
   - **Console Evidence**: `ability: undefined, apCost: undefined, hasEnoughAP: false`
   - **Fix A**: Removed UI auto-processing, moved enemy AI to combat system
   - **Fix B**: Updated `getAbility()` to check both player AND enemy ability databases
   - **Files**: 
     - `src/ui/CombatScreen.ts` (removed setTimeout auto-processing)
     - `src/systems/combat.ts` (added `processEnemyAI()` function)
     - `src/data/abilities.ts` (updated `getAbility()` to check enemy abilities)

5. ✅ **Targeting Dead Enemies** - Could target defeated enemies
   - **Problem**: No filtering for alive enemies
   - **Fix**: Filter `combat.enemyTeam.find(e => e.isAlive)`
   - **File**: `src/ui/CombatScreen.ts` line 381

6. ✅ **Click-to-Target Enhancement** - NEW FEATURE!
   - Added targeting mode with green glow animations
   - Click enemies to select target
   - Cancel button during targeting
   - CSS animations: pulse, hover scale, dead grayscale
   - **Files**: `src/ui/CombatScreen.ts` (+150 lines), `src/style.css` (+60 lines)

**Implementation Details**:

*Combat Screen Features*:
- Turn-based combat UI with player/enemy teams
- HP/AP bars with color-coded health (green/yellow/red)
- Multi-action support (sequential abilities + "End Turn")
- Combat log with scrolling history (last 20 entries)
- Status effects display with duration tracking
- Reserve swap modal on team wipe
- Click-to-target enemy selection

*Enemy AI Flow*:
```typescript
1. processStartOfTurn(state) called
2. If enemy turn: processEnemyAI(state)

   b. Get ability using getAbility() - now checks enemy abilities!
   c. Check if enemy has enough AP
   d. Choose targets based on ability.targetType
   e. Execute ability
3. Call endTurn(state)
4. Loop continues
```

*getAbility() Fix*:
```typescript
// Before: Only checked player abilities
return ABILITIES[abilityId];

// After: Checks both player and enemy abilities
const playerAbility = ABILITIES[abilityId];
if (playerAbility) return playerAbility;
return getEnemyAbility(abilityId); // Import from enemyAbilities.ts
```

**Build Results**:
- ✅ TypeScript errors: 0
- ✅ Bundle size: 163.46 KB (+11 KB for enemy abilities - expected)

- ✅ Multi-action combat (use multiple abilities per turn)
- ✅ Click-to-target enemy selection
- ✅ Auto-victory when all enemies defeated

## Development Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Type Safety First**: Strict TypeScript mode ensures compile-time error catching
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between types, systems, data, and UI
3. **Formula Transparency**: All game formulas centralized in `utils/formulas.ts` and `systems/damage.ts`
4. **Ability Balance**: AP costs scale with power level, unlock progression at levels 1/5/10/20
5. **Character Diversity**: Each type has distinct role, stat distribution, and AP regen rate
6. **Equipment Scaling**: Dynamic stat scaling ensures equipment remains relevant at all levels
7. **Status Effects**: Flexible system supports stacking, DOT/HOT, and control effects
8. **Stat Modifiers**: Flat bonuses and multiplicative modifiers for deep customization
9. **Combat Flow**: Turn-based with multi-action support for tactical decision-making
10. **Reserve System**: Team wipe recovery adds strategic depth

### Technical Highlights
- Pure TypeScript with no frameworks (as per design requirements)
- Semantic HTML structure ready for UI implementation
- Comprehensive type system enables autocomplete and type checking
- Modular architecture allows independent system development
- Formula-based calculations ensure consistency
- Combat system supports complex multi-action scenarios
- Status effect integration with combat flow
- Damage calculations match game design specifications exactly

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing via browser console
- Type checking with `npm run type-check`
- Build validation with `npm run build`
- Visual testing in development server
