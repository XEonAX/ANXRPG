## 🌳 Skill Tree System

### Design Philosophy
- **Linear Progression**: Nodes unlock sequentially with prerequisites
- **Balanced Rewards**: Mix of stat bonuses and ability unlocks
- **Long-Term Goals**: 5th/6th ability slots at higher levels
- **Character Identity**: Each tree reflects character archetype

### Node Distribution Per Character
Each character has **20 skill nodes**:
- **~14 stat bonus nodes** (HP, ATK, DEF, MAG, RES, SPD, CRT, EVA, ACC)
- **~2 ability slot nodes** (5th slot at level 30, 6th at level 65)
- **~3 multi-point nodes** (require 2-3 skill points)
- **1 grandmaster node** (level 100, massive bonuses)

### Example: Alpha (Paladin) Skill Tree
```
Row 1 (Levels 1-10):
├─ Fortified Health I (+25 HP)
├─ Shield Mastery I (+8 DEF)
└─ Holy Resistance I (+6 RES)

Row 2 (Levels 10-25):
├─ Righteous Might I (+10 ATK)
├─ Fortified Health II (+40 HP, 2 points)
├─ Shield Mastery II (+12 DEF)
└─ Divine Precision (+5% ACC)

Row 3 (Levels 30-50):
├─ Divine Arsenal (5th ability slot, 2 points) ⭐
├─ Fortified Health III (+60 HP, 2 points)
├─ Righteous Might II (+18 ATK, 2 points)
├─ Holy Resistance II (+10 RES)
└─ Shield Mastery III (+20 DEF, 2 points)

Row 4 (Levels 55-75):
├─ Blessed Agility (+8 SPD)
├─ Fortified Health IV (+100 HP, 3 points)
├─ Holy Mastery (6th ability slot, 3 points) ⭐
├─ Righteous Might III (+30 ATK, 2 points)
└─ Shield Mastery IV (+35 DEF, 3 points)

Row 5 (Levels 80-100):
├─ Holy Resistance III (+18 RES, 2 points)
├─ Divine Fortitude (+150 HP, 3 points)
└─ Paladin Grandmaster (+50 HP +25 ATK +25 DEF +15 RES, 3 points) 🏆
```

### Total Skill Points Required
- **Total nodes per tree**: 20 nodes
- **Total skill points needed**: ~35-40 points (accounting for multi-point nodes)
- **Points available at level 100**: 99 skill points
- **Result**: Players can max out their skill tree and have points to spare

## 🎖️ Character Recruitment System

### Recruitment Milestones
| Victories | Recruitment | Roster Size |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 20        | 1st recruit | 2           |
| 40        | 2nd recruit | 3           |
| 60        | 3rd recruit | 4           |
| 80        | 4th recruit | 5           |
| 100       | 5th recruit | 6 (max)     |

### Key Features
- **Starting Roster**: 1 character (player's choice)
- **Recruitment Frequency**: Every 20 victories
- **Roster Cap**: 6 characters maximum
- **New Character Level**: Always start at level 1
- **Duplicate Types**: Allowed (can have 2 Alphas, etc.)
- **Retirement Option**: At 100 victories with full roster, can retire one character

### Victory Counting Rules
- ✅ **Counts**: Victories at stage 5 or higher
- ❌ **Does not count**: Stages 1-4 (too trivial)
- ✅ **Farming allowed**: Replaying same stage counts

## 🔧 System Functions

### Skill Tree Functions (13 functions)
```typescript
// Core Functions
unlockSkillNode(character, nodeId) → boolean
canUnlockNode(character, nodeId) → { canUnlock, reason }
getAvailableNodes(character) → SkillNode[]
getUnlockedNodes(character) → SkillNode[]

// Bonus Calculation
calculateSkillTreeBonuses(character) → SkillTreeBonuses
getMaxAbilitySlots(character) → number
getSkillTreeAbilities(character) → string[]

// Progress Tracking
getNodeProgress(character, nodeId) → SkillNodeProgress | null
isNodeUnlocked(character, nodeId) → boolean
getTotalSkillPointsInvested(character) → number

// Summary & Utilities
getSkillTreeSummary(character) → summary object
resetSkillTree(character) → number (points refunded)
```

### Recruitment Functions (11 functions)
```typescript
// Milestone Tracking
getAvailableRecruitments(victories) → number
getNextRecruitmentMilestone(victories) → number | null
getBattlesUntilNextRecruitment(victories) → number | null

// Recruitment Actions
canRecruitCharacter(victories, rosterSize) → boolean
recruitCharacter(type, name?) → Character
needsRetirement(victories, rosterSize) → boolean
retireCharacter(roster, characterId) → Character | null

// Status & Display
getRecruitmentStatus(victories, rosterSize) → status object
shouldCountForRecruitment(stageNumber) → boolean
getRecruitmentUnlockMessage(milestone, count) → string
```

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### 1. Character Stat Calculation
**Location**: `src/systems/character.ts` → `calculateCurrentStats()`

```typescript
// Apply skill tree bonuses (Phase 8)
const skillTreeBonuses = calculateSkillTreeBonuses(character);
Object.entries(skillTreeBonuses.stats).forEach(([stat, value]) => {
  if (stat === 'maxHp') {
    baseStats.maxHp += value;
    // Also increase current HP proportionally if at max
    if (baseStats.hp === baseStats.maxHp - value) {
      baseStats.hp = baseStats.maxHp;
    }
  } else if (stat in baseStats) {
    (baseStats as any)[stat] += value;
  }
});
```

**Result**: Skill tree bonuses now automatically apply to all character stats!

### 2. Combat Victory Tracking
**Location**: `src/systems/combat.ts` → `shouldVictoryCountForRecruitment()`

```typescript
/**
 * Check if combat victory should count toward recruitment progress
 * 
 * NOTE: This is called from the game loop (Phase 9) after combat ends.
 * The game loop has access to both CombatState and GameState and can
 * increment PlayerProgress.totalBattlesWon when appropriate.
 */
export function shouldVictoryCountForRecruitment(stageNumber: number): boolean {
  return shouldCountForRecruitment(stageNumber);
}
```

**Integration Point**: Phase 9 (Campaign System) will call this after combat ends.

### 3. XP System (Already Integrated in Phase 6)
**Location**: `src/systems/combat.ts` → `checkBattleEnd()`

XP distribution is fully functional:
- All 6 characters (active + reserve) receive XP on victory
- Level-ups award 1 skill point automatically
- `awardXp()` function integrated into combat loop
