**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for manual playtesting

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

### 1. Manual Playtest Guide
**File**: `docs/PLAYTEST_GUIDE.md`

Comprehensive 70-minute playtest checklist covering:
- ✅ All 6 character types (Alpha through Zeta)
- ✅ Combat mechanics (multi-action, AI, targeting, status effects)
- ✅ Progression systems (leveling, skill trees, equipment, recruitment)
- ✅ Team management (active/reserve, drag-drop, reserve swap)
- ✅ Campaign progression (stage unlocking, boss battles, difficulty)
- ✅ Save system (auto-save, manual, export/import)
- ✅ UI/UX (responsive design, navigation, visual polish)
- ✅ Edge cases (large numbers, empty teams, ability spam)
- ✅ Balance targets for early/mid/late game

### 2. Console Helper Functions
**File**: `src/tests/playtestHelpers.ts`

Browser console tools for quick testing:
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
playtest.help()                    // Show all commands
playtest.quickStart('Beta')        // Start game with Beta character
playtest.showStats()               // View current game state
playtest.levelUp(0, 10)            // Level up 1st character by 10
playtest.grantVictories(20)        // Add 20 victories (for recruitment)
playtest.fullHeal()                // Restore all HP/AP
```

## 🚀 How to Start Playtesting

### Option 1: Full Manual Playtest (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/user/Projects/ANXRPG
npm run dev
```

Then follow the guide in `docs/PLAYTEST_GUIDE.md`:
1. Test each character type (6 tests × ~3 min = 18 min)
2. Test combat systems (10 min)
3. Test progression (15 min)
4. Test team management (10 min)
5. Test campaign (10 min)
6. Test save system (5 min)
7. Test UI/UX (5 min)
8. Test edge cases (5 min)

**Total Time**: ~70 minutes for complete playtest

### Option 2: Quick Smoke Test (15 minutes)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Start new game with Beta (Rogue)
2. Play through Stages 1-5
3. Check combat feels good
4. Recruit 2nd character (use console: `playtest.grantVictories(20)`)
5. Test team management
6. Test save/load
7. Check settings screen

### Option 3: Specific Feature Testing

Use console helpers for targeted testing:

```javascript
// Quick setup for testing recruitment
playtest.quickStart('Alpha');
playtest.grantVictories(19);
// Now win 1 battle to trigger recruitment

// Quick setup for testing high-level content
playtest.quickStart('Gamma');
playtest.levelUp(0, 20);
playtest.fullHeal();
// Now go test Stage 30 bosses

// Quick setup for testing equipment
playtest.quickStart('Delta');
playtest.levelUp(0, 10);
// Win battles, collect gear, test inventory
```
