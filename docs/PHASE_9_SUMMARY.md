### Reward Modifiers

**Normal Stages**:
- XP multiplier: 1.0× (base)

**Boss Stages**:
- XP multiplier: 1.5-2.0× (stage 100 is 2.0×)

## 🔧 Campaign System Functions (22 Total)

### Core Progression (5 functions)

```typescript
initializeCampaignProgress() → CampaignProgress
// Initialize new campaign with stage 1 unlocked

getCurrentStage(progress) → Stage | null
// Get the stage player is currently viewing

unlockNextStage(progress) → number | null
// Unlock next stage in sequence, returns stage number or null if complete

setCurrentStage(progress, stageNumber) → boolean
// Set which stage player is viewing (must be unlocked)

completeStage(progress, stageNumber, victory, xp, loot) → StageResult
// Process stage completion, update progress, unlock next stage
```

### Access Control (2 functions)

```typescript
canAccessStage(stageNumber, progress, characters) → { canAccess, reason? }
// Check if stage can be accessed (unlocked + level requirements)

getStageInfo(stageNumber, progress, characters) → StageInfo | null
// Get detailed stage information for display
```

### Enemy & Reward Generation (3 functions)

```typescript
generateStageEnemies(stage) → Enemy[]
// Generate enemy team for a stage (boss or normal)

calculateStageXpReward(stage, enemies) → number
// Calculate total XP with stage multipliers

generateStageEquipment(stage, enemies) → Equipment[]
// Generate equipment drops with stage multipliers
```

### Query Functions (12 functions)

## 🎮 Key Features

### 1. Progressive Unlocking

Stages unlock sequentially:
- Start with stage 1 unlocked
- Completing stage N unlocks stage N+1
- Can replay any unlocked stage (farming)
- Max 100 stages

### 2. Boss Battle System

Every 10th stage is a boss:
- Solo boss enemy with 2.5× stats
- Can summon minions during battle
- Higher XP rewards (1.5-2.0× multiplier)
- Better loot drops (2.0-3.0× multiplier)

### 3. Victory Tracking

Two types of victory counting:
- **Stage victories**: Per-stage clear count (for farming)
- **Total victories**: Global count for recruitment system
  - Only stages 5+ count towards recruitment
  - Used for 20/40/60/80/100 victory milestones

### 4. Enemy Generation

Automatic enemy team generation:
- Boss stages: Use `generateBossEncounter(stage)`
- Normal stages: Random team from tier
- Respects stage's enemy team size (1-3)
- Enemy levels within stage's level range

### 5. Reward Calculation

Dynamic reward calculation:
- **XP**: Base enemy XP × stage multiplier
  - Normal: 1.0× (no change)
  - Boss: 1.5-2.0× (more XP)
- **Equipment**: 20% base drop chance × stage multiplier
  - Normal: 1.0× (20% per enemy)
  - Boss: 2.0-3.0× (40-60% per enemy)

### 6. Stage Farming

Players can replay any unlocked stage:
- No limit on replays
- Full rewards each time
- Victory count tracks farming
- Used for grinding XP/equipment

## 📈 Campaign Progression Flow

### New Game
```
1. initializeCampaignProgress()
2. Player selects starting character
3. Stage 1 unlocked and ready
```

### Starting a Battle
```
1. Player selects stage from unlocked stages
2. canAccessStage() checks eligibility
3. generateStageEnemies() creates enemy team
4. Battle begins (existing combat system)
```

### Completing a Battle
```
1. Combat ends with victory or defeat
2. If victory:
   a. calculateStageXpReward() calculates XP
   b. generateStageEquipment() rolls for loot
   c. completeStage() updates progress
   d. Next stage unlocked (if first clear)
   e. Victory count incremented (if stage 5+)
3. If defeat:
   a. No progression changes
   b. Can retry stage
```

### Campaign Completion
```
1. Complete all 100 stages
2. isCampaignComplete() returns true
3. Player can still farm any stage
4. Can start new game (future: new game+)
```

## 🔗 Integration with Other Systems

### ✅ Combat System (Phase 6)
- Combat victory triggers `completeStage()`
- XP/loot distributed to characters
- Victory detection works with campaign

### ✅ Enemy System (Phase 7)
- `generateStageEnemies()` uses enemy templates
- Boss encounters use boss mechanics
- Enemy levels scale with stage

### ✅ Equipment System (Phase 4)
- `generateStageEquipment()` uses equipment generation
- Drop chances modified by stage multipliers
- Equipment level matches enemy level

### ✅ Progression System (Phase 8)
- Victory tracking for recruitment system
- Stage 5+ victories count towards milestones
- XP distributed to all 6 characters

### ⏳ Save System (Phase 10 - Next)
- `CampaignProgress` ready for serialization
- All campaign state in one object
- Set/Map structures need JSON conversion

## 🎨 Stage Flavor Examples

**Stage 1: "Slime Encounter"**  
*"Your first encounter with the weak slimes of the forest."*

**Stage 10: "The Slime King"**  
*"Face the mighty Slime King, ruler of the forest!"*

## 📝 Usage Example

```typescript
// Initialize campaign
const progress = initializeCampaignProgress();

// Get current stage
const stage = getCurrentStage(progress);
console.log(`Stage ${stage.stageNumber}: ${stage.name}`);

// Generate enemies for battle
const enemies = generateStageEnemies(stage);

// ... Run combat ...

// Complete stage on victory
if (victory) {
  const xp = calculateStageXpReward(stage, enemies);
  const loot = generateStageEquipment(stage, enemies);
  
  const result = completeStage(progress, stage.stageNumber, true, xp, loot);
  
  if (result.firstTimeClear) {
    console.log(`First clear! Next stage unlocked: ${result.nextStageUnlocked}`);
  }
  
  console.log(`Total victories: ${progress.totalVictories}`);
}

// Check campaign summary
const summary = getCampaignSummary(progress);
console.log(`Campaign ${summary.completionPercentage}% complete`);
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### None Currently!

All campaign functions tested and working. System is ready for:
- Phase 10: Save/Load integration
- Phase 11: UI implementation (campaign map screen)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Phase 10)

**Save/Load System**:
1. Serialize `CampaignProgress` to JSON
2. Convert Set → Array, Map → Object
3. Save to LocalStorage
4. Load and validate save data
5. Auto-save after stage completion

**UI Integration** (Phase 11):
1. Campaign map screen
2. Stage selection interface
3. Progress indicator
4. Boss stage highlighting
5. Victory count display
