### Option 2: Start Phase 12 (Polish)
Add flavor text and animations to make the game feel more alive:
- Ability descriptions with personality
- Equipment lore
- Combat animations
- Sound effects (optional)

### Option 3: Balance & Test
Play through several battles and note:
- Are battles too easy/hard?
