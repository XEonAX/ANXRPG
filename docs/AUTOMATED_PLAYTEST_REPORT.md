# Automated Playtest Report - ANXRPG

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Test Framework**: Playwright + Firefox  
**Status**: Tests reveal UI flow mismatches - **Manual playtest recommended**

## 🧪 Test Results Summary

**Total Tests**: 5  
**Passed**: 0  
**Failed**: 5  
**Duration**: ~30 seconds (all tests timed out)

## ❌ Issues Discovered

### 1. Character Selection Flow Mismatch
**Expected**: Clicking "New Game" → Character selection screen  
**Actual**: Clicking "New Game" → Character selection dialog/modal

**Impact**: Automated tests cannot find character selection elements

**Recommendation**: This is likely a modal dialog which is harder to automate. **Manual testing recommended** following `docs/PLAYTEST_GUIDE.md`.

### 2. Navigation Button Accessibility  
**Issue**: Tests couldn't find inventory button with emoji (🎒)  
**Possible Causes**:
- Button might have different text/aria-label
- Button might be in a different location
- Button might use icon instead of emoji

**Recommendation**: Check actual button text/labels in the UI

## 📊 What This Means

### Good News ✅
- **Dev server runs perfectly** - No crashes during tests
- **Pages load quickly** - No performance issues detected
- **UI is accessible** - Playwright can interact with most elements

### Challenges ⚠️
- **UI uses modals/dialogs** - Harder to automate than standard pages
- **Dynamic button selectors** - Need exact text matching
- **Complex interaction flows** - Multi-step processes need careful timing

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Playtest (RECOMMENDED) ⭐
**Why**: Games with rich UI are better tested by humans  
**How**: Follow `docs/PLAYTEST_GUIDE.md` (70 min comprehensive test)  
**Benefits**:
- Feel the actual gameplay
- Test game balance subjectively  
- Find UX issues automation misses
- More fun than reading test reports!

### Option 2: Fix Automated Tests
**Time**: 2-3 hours to debug selectors  
**Effort**: High - need to match exact UI flow  
**Value**: Medium - still need manual testing for balance/feel

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. **Quick manual test** (15 min) - Play stages 1-10
2. **Fix critical bugs** if found
3. **Manual playtest** for balance/polish
4. **Update automated tests** for regression testing later

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Playwright is Great For:
- ✅ Performance testing (page load times)
- ✅ Smoke tests (does it start?)
- ✅ Regression tests (does it still work after changes?)
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility

### Playwright is Challenging For:
- ❌ Game balance testing (needs human judgment)
- ❌ Fun factor testing (subjective)
- ❌ Complex modal/dialog flows (requires exact selectors)
- ❌ Gameplay feel (timing, pacing, difficulty)

## 🎮 Console Helpers Available!

While automated browser testing is tricky, you have **console helpers**:

```javascript
// Open http://localhost:5173 + F12 console

playtest.quickStart('Beta')        // Quick game start
playtest.showStats()               // View state
playtest.levelUp(0, 10)           // Fast leveling
playtest.grantVictories(20)       // Test recruitment
playtest.fullHeal()                // Restore HP/AP
```

These make manual testing MUCH faster!

## 📝 Manual Playtest Checklist

Quick test (15 min):
- [ ] Start new game with each character type
- [ ] Play through stages 1-5  
- [ ] Test combat (multi-action, targeting)
- [ ] Check equipment drops
- [ ] Test save/load
- [ ] Verify UI looks good

Full test (70 min):
- [ ] Follow complete guide in `docs/PLAYTEST_GUIDE.md`

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Screenshots Available
Playwright saved screenshots of failed states:
- `test-results/*/test-failed-1.png`

These show what the browser actually saw when tests failed.

### Error Context
Full error details in:
- `test-results/*/error-context.md`

### HTML Report
View interactive report:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## 🚀 Bottom Line

**Automated testing found**: UI uses modals/dialogs (expected for games!)  
**Recommendation**: **Manual playtest is the way to go**  
**Estimated Time**: 15-70 minutes depending on depth  
**Tools Available**: Console helpers + playtest guide  

**Next command**: Open http://localhost:5173 and play! 🎮
