#### 5. Skill Tree Section (Full Width)

- **Click to unlock** functionality:

  - Recalculates character stats
  - Auto-saves game
  - Emits level-up event
  - Re-renders screen to show changes

## Integration

### Navigation Flow
- From **Team Management** → Click "👁️ View" → **Character Sheet**
- From **Character Sheet** → Click "📦 Open Inventory" → **Inventory** (next screen)
- From **Character Sheet** → Click "⬅️ Back to Team" → **Team Management**

### Data Binding
- Reads character from `uiState.saveData.roster`
- Equipment loaded from `uiState.saveData.inventory`
- Skill tree loaded from `data/skillTrees.ts`
- Abilities loaded from `data/abilities.ts`

### Save Integration
- Auto-saves when unlocking skill nodes
- Emits `CHARACTER_LEVEL_UP` event
- Updates UIState context for re-rendering

## CSS Styling (~330 lines)

**Components Styled**:
- `.character-sheet__header` - Character info banner
- `.stats-table` - Stats display table
- `.equipment-grid` - 2-column equipment layout
- `.equipment-slot` - Individual slot cards
- `.abilities-list` - Ability sections
- `.ability-card` - Individual ability display
- `.skill-tree` - Tree container
- `.skill-node` - Individual nodes (3 states)

**Features**:
- Rarity colors for equipment (common → legendary)
- Animated skill points counter (pulses when available)
- XP progress bar with gradient
- Hover effects on available skill nodes
- Responsive grid layout (3 columns → 1 column on mobile)
- Tooltips on stats and nodes

## Technical Highlights

### Type Safety
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Proper integration with SaveData.roster
- Correct SkillNode type usage (abilityId, not abilityUnlock)

### Skill Tree Integration
- Uses `canUnlockNode()` to validate prerequisites
- Uses `unlockSkillNode()` to spend points
- Uses `calculateSkillTreeBonuses()` to update stats
- Handles multi-point nodes correctly

### Performance
- Efficient re-rendering via ScreenManager.updateContext()
- Only re-renders on skill point spending
- No unnecessary re-calculations
