# Bug Fix: Defeat Healing and Single Character Defeat

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Phase**: 11 (UI Implementation) - Bug Fixes

## Issues Identified

### Issue #1: No Healing After Defeat
**Problem**: When the player loses a battle, characters are not healed. Only victories trigger automatic healing between battles.

**Impact**: Players who lose battles must manually heal or enter the next battle with reduced HP, creating an unfair difficulty spiral.

### Issue #2: Single Character Game Stuck
**Problem**: When a player has only 1 character (no reserve team) and that character dies, the game could get stuck in an unclear state.

**Impact**: Players with a single character roster cannot properly experience defeat and return to the campaign map.

## Root Causes

### Issue #1 Root Cause
In `BattleResultsScreen.ts`, the healing logic was only triggered on victory:
```typescript
if (isVictory && stageNumber) {
  // Fully restore all characters after victory (heal HP and AP)
  uiState.saveData.roster.forEach(char => {
    fullyRestoreCharacter(char);
  });
  // ... other victory logic
}
```

Additionally, defeat was handled in `CombatScreen.ts` by returning directly to the campaign map without going through the battle results screen, bypassing any healing logic.

### Issue #2 Root Cause
The combat system in `combat.ts` already handled this correctly:
- When all active team members die, it checks for alive reserve members
- If `aliveReserve.length > 0`, sets `phase = 'team-wipe'` (offers swap)
- If `aliveReserve.length === 0`, sets `phase = 'defeat'` (immediate defeat)

However, the UI flow in `CombatScreen.ts` was bypassing the battle results screen on defeat, going straight back to campaign map.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix #1: Unified Battle Results Flow
**File**: `src/ui/CombatScreen.ts`

Changed defeat handling to navigate to battle results screen instead of directly to campaign:

```typescript
} else if (combat.phase === 'defeat') {
  // Reset selected target on defeat
  selectedTarget = null;
  
  // Navigate to battle results to show defeat screen
  setTimeout(() => {
    EventBus.emit(GameEvents.COMBAT_END);
    ScreenManager.navigateTo('battleResults', { 
      combat, 
      uiState, 
      stage: stageNumber 
    });
  }, 1500);
}
```

**Before**: Defeat ‚Üí Campaign Map (no healing, no battle results screen)  
**After**: Defeat ‚Üí Battle Results Screen ‚Üí Campaign Map (with healing)

### Fix #2: Healing on Both Victory and Defeat
**File**: `src/ui/BattleResultsScreen.ts`

Moved healing logic outside the victory-only condition:

```typescript
const continueBtn = createButton(
  isVictory ? '‚û°Ô∏è Continue' : '‚¨ÖÔ∏è Return to Campaign',
  () => {
    // Fully restore all characters after battle (heal HP and AP) - whether victory or defeat
    uiState.saveData.roster.forEach(char => {
      fullyRestoreCharacter(char);
    });
    
    if (isVictory && stageNumber) {
      // Mark stage as complete, save progress
      completeStage(...);
      showNotification('‚úÖ Party fully healed! Progress saved!', 'success');
    } else {
      // Defeat - just save the healing
      saveGame(uiState.saveData);
      EventBus.emit(GameEvents.GAME_SAVED);
      showNotification('‚úÖ Party fully healed!', 'success');
    }
    
    // Return to campaign map
    ScreenManager.navigateTo('campaignMap', { uiState });
  },
  'btn btn--primary btn--large'
);
```

**Key Changes**:
1. Healing now happens for **both** victory and defeat
2. Victory still records stage completion and XP/loot
3. Defeat now saves the post-healing state
4. Both paths show appropriate notifications

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Defeat with Multiple Characters
1. Start battle with 2-3 active characters
2. Let all active characters die (with or without reserve)
3. **Expected**: Battle results screen shows defeat, all roster characters healed
4. **Verified**: ‚úÖ Works correctly

### Test Case 2: Defeat with Single Character
1. Start new game with only 1 character in roster
2. Enter battle and let character die
3. **Expected**: Combat system sets `phase = 'defeat'`, navigates to battle results, character healed
4. **Verified**: ‚úÖ Works correctly (combat.ts already handles this properly)

### Test Case 3: Victory Healing (Regression Check)
1. Win a battle
2. **Expected**: Characters healed, stage completed, progress saved
3. **Verified**: ‚úÖ Still works as before

### Test Case 4: Reserve Swap Flow (Unchanged)
1. Active team dies but reserve has alive characters
2. **Expected**: Reserve swap dialog appears (unchanged behavior)
3. **Verified**: ‚úÖ Not affected by changes

## Files Modified

1. **src/ui/CombatScreen.ts** (Line 598-611)
   - Changed defeat navigation from campaign map to battle results screen
   
2. **src/ui/BattleResultsScreen.ts** (Line 73-109)
   - Moved healing logic to execute for both victory and defeat
   - Added defeat-specific save and notification

## Game Design Impact

### Positive Changes
- **Fairer progression**: Players aren't punished twice for defeat (lose battle AND lose HP)
- **Consistent UX**: All battles end with the battle results screen
- **Better feedback**: Defeat screen shows what happened before returning to campaign
- **Single character viability**: Players can safely play with just 1 character

### No Breaking Changes
- Victory flow unchanged
- Reserve swap dialog still appears when appropriate
- XP and loot rewards still only given on victory
- Stage progression still only on victory

## Future Considerations

### Optional Penalties (Not Implemented)
If desired for balance, could add optional defeat penalties:
- Partial healing instead of full (e.g., 50% HP restore)
- Gold/resource cost for healing after defeat
- Equipment durability loss
- XP penalty

These can be added via game settings if needed.

## Bonus Fix: Combat Log UI Stability

### Issue #3: Moving Action Panel (UX)
**Problem**: As the combat log grows with more messages, it pushes the action panel (ability buttons) down, causing UI elements to move during combat.

**Impact**: Moving UI elements during gameplay is terrible UX - players lose their visual reference points and may misclick abilities.

**Solution**: Changed combat log from `max-height` to fixed `height: 200px` with internal scrolling.

**File**: `src/style.css` (Line 1305-1327)

```css
/* Before: max-height allows growth */
.combat-log {
  max-height: 200px;
  overflow-y: auto;
}

.combat-log__messages {
  max-height: 150px;
  overflow-y: auto;
}

/* After: fixed height with flex layout */
.combat-log {
  height: 200px; /* Fixed height to prevent UI movement */
  overflow: hidden;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.combat-log__title {
  flex-shrink: 0; /* Title stays fixed */
}

.combat-log__messages {
  height: 100%; /* Take remaining space */
  overflow-y: auto; /* Scroll only messages */
  flex: 1;
  justify-content: flex-end; /* Bottom-align messages */
}
```

**Result**: 
- Action panel stays in exactly the same position throughout entire battle
- Only the messages inside the log scroll
- Newest messages appear at the bottom (better UX for chat-style logs)

## Enhancement: Keyboard Shortcuts

### Feature #1: Combat Keyboard Shortcuts
**Added**: Keyboard shortcuts for faster combat gameplay

**Implementation**: `src/ui/CombatScreen.ts`

**Shortcuts**:
- **Number keys (1-4+)**: Use abilities by pressing their corresponding number
- **Enter or Space**: End turn
- **Visual indicators**: Each ability shows `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.

**Features**:
- Only active during player turns (not enemy turns)
- Disabled when typing in input fields
- Only triggers if character has enough AP
- Auto-cleanup when combat ends

**CSS Addition** (`src/style.css`):
```css
.ability-btn__shortcut {
  font-size: var(--font-size-xs);
  color: var(--text-muted);
  background: var(--bg-secondary);
  padding: 2px 6px;
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
  font-family: var(--font-family-mono);
  margin-top: 2px;
}
```

### Feature #2: Battle Results Keyboard Shortcuts
**Added**: Two-button system with keyboard shortcuts for post-battle navigation

**Implementation**: `src/ui/BattleResultsScreen.ts`

**For Victory (Stages 1-99)**:
1. **‚öîÔ∏è Next Battle (Enter)** - Primary button, auto-starts next stage
2. **üó∫Ô∏è Back to Campaign (Esc)** - Secondary button, returns to map

**For Defeat or Final Stage**:
- **‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back to Campaign (Enter)** - Single button to return

**Features**:
- **Auto-progress**: Enter key chains battles together for fast progression
- **Escape route**: Esc key returns to campaign map to review progress
- **Auto-start support**: Campaign map accepts `autoStartStage` parameter
- Both buttons trigger healing and save progress

**User Flow Examples**:
- **Fast progression**: Stage 5 Victory ‚Üí Press Enter ‚Üí Stage 6 starts
- **Return to map**: Stage 5 Victory ‚Üí Press Esc ‚Üí View campaign map
- **After defeat**: Press Enter ‚Üí Healed and returned to campaign
