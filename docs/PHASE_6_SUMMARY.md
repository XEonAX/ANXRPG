# Phase 6: Combat Engine - Implementation Summary

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ 85% COMPLETE (Core Functional, Rewards Integration Pending)  
**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Version**: 0.4.0 (Combat Engine Release)

## Overview
Implemented the core turn-based combat system with multi-action support, ability execution, damage/healing, status effect integration, and team management. **Combat is fully functional from battle start to victory/defeat detection**, but XP distribution and equipment drops are not yet integrated.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Combat State Management (`systems/combat.ts`)
**Status**: âœ… Complete

#### Core Functions Implemented
- `initializeCombat()` - Initialize new combat with teams
- `calculateTurnOrder()` - Speed-based turn order with random tiebreaker
- `setPlayerTurnOrder()` - One-time player character ordering
- `startCombat()` - Begin battle and start first turn
- `getCurrentCombatant()` - Get active combatant
- `getCombatantEntity()` - Extract Character/Enemy from combatant
- `processStartOfTurn()` - Handle AP regen, status ticks, control effects
- `processEndOfTurn()` - Handle status ticks, duration decrement
- `endTurn()` - Advance to next combatant, check battle end
- `executeAbility()` - Full ability execution with damage/healing/effects
- `resolveTargets()` - Convert target IDs to entities based on ability type
- `checkBattleEnd()` - Detect victory/defeat/team-wipe
- `swapReserveTeam()` - Activate reserve after team wipe
- `acceptDefeat()` - Accept loss instead of swapping
- `addCombatLog()` - Log combat events
- `getCurrentTurnLog()` - Get current turn messages
- `getRecentLog()` - Get last N log entries

#### Combat Flow
1. **Initialization**: `initializeCombat()` â†’ `setPlayerTurnOrder()` â†’ `startCombat()`
2. **Turn Loop**: 
   - `processStartOfTurn()` â†’ Regen AP, apply DOT/HOT, check control
   - Player/AI actions â†’ `executeAbility()`
   - `endTurn()` â†’ Apply end-of-turn effects, advance turn order
3. **Battle End**: Detect victory (all enemies dead) or team wipe (trigger reserve swap)

#### Turn Order System
- **Speed-based**: Higher SPD stat = earlier in turn order
- **Team-level sorting**: Player vs enemy teams, sorted by speed
- **Player ordering**: One-time character order selection within player team
- **Random tiebreaker**: Equal speed = random order
- **Dynamic removal**: Dead combatants removed from turn order

#### Multi-Action Support
- Characters can use multiple abilities per turn if AP available
- `actionsThisTurn` array tracks all actions in current turn
- `turnInProgress` flag indicates active multi-action turn
- AP consumed per ability, minimum 1 damage always dealt

### 2. Damage Calculation System (`systems/damage.ts`)
**Status**: âœ… Complete

#### Damage Functions
- `calculatePhysicalDamage()` - (ATK Ã— mult) - (DEF Ã— 0.5)
- `calculateMagicalDamage()` - (MAG Ã— mult) - (RES Ã— 0.5)
- `calculateHitChance()` - clamp(ACC - (EVA Ã— 0.5), 5, 95)
- `checkHit()` - Roll vs hit chance (unless guaranteed hit)
- `checkCritical()` - Roll vs CRT% for 2Ã— damage
- `applyCriticalMultiplier()` - Multiply damage by 2.0
- `calculateAbilityDamage()` - Full ability damage with hit/miss/crit
- `calculateHealing()` - Healing calculation with overheal tracking
- `calculateLifestealHealing()` - % of damage dealt returned as HP
- `calculateAoEDamage()` - Damage to multiple targets
- `calculateAoEHealing()` - Healing to multiple targets

#### Damage Formula (as per GAME_DESIGN.md)
```typescript
// Physical
baseDamage = (ATK * multiplier) - (DEF * 0.5)

// Magical
baseDamage = (MAG * multiplier) - (RES * 0.5)

// Critical Hit
if (random(1-100) <= CRT) {
  damage *= 2.0
}

// Hit/Miss
hitChance = clamp(ACC - (EVA * 0.5), 5, 95)
```

#### Optional Variance
- Configurable Â±10% random variance via `DamageCalculationOptions`
- Can be disabled for consistent damage

### 3. Status Effects Integration
**Status**: âœ… Complete

#### Updates to `systems/statusEffects.ts`
- **Type Support**: All functions now accept `CombatEntity = Character | Enemy`
- **Functions Updated** (14 total):
  - `applyStatusEffect()` - Apply to any combat entity
  - `removeStatusEffect()` - Remove from any entity
  - `processStatusEffectTicks()` - Process DOT/HOT on any entity
  - `decrementStatusEffectDurations()` - Decrement for any entity
  - `isUnderControlEffect()` - Check control on any entity
  - `getActiveControlEffects()` - Get control effects on any entity
  - `calculateStatusEffectStatModifiers()` - Calculate modifiers for any entity
  - `hasStatusEffect()`, `getStatusEffect()`, etc. - All entity-agnostic

#### Combat Integration
- **Start of Turn**: Process DOT/HOT with `processStatusEffectTicks(entity, true)`
- **End of Turn**: Process DOT/HOT with `processStatusEffectTicks(entity, false)`, then `decrementStatusEffectDurations()`
- **Control Effects**: Check `isUnderControlEffect()` â†’ skip turn if true
- **Ability Effects**: Apply status effects from ability with chance rolls

### 4. Ability Execution System
**Status**: âœ… Complete

#### Full Ability Resolution (`executeAbility`)
1. **Validate**: Check actor, ability exists, AP available
2. **Consume AP**: Deduct AP cost from actor
3. **Resolve Targets**: Convert target IDs to entities based on `targetType`
4. **Process Damage**:
   - Calculate damage via `calculateAoEDamage()`
   - Apply damage to targets with `damageCharacter()`
   - Check for deaths, mark in result
   - Handle lifesteal healing if applicable
5. **Process Healing**:
   - Calculate healing via `calculateAoEHealing()`
   - Apply healing to targets with `healCharacter()`
6. **Apply Status Effects**:
   - Roll for each status effect chance
   - Apply to targets via `applyStatusEffect()`
7. **AP Restore/Drain**:
   - Restore AP to self if specified
   - Drain AP from targets if specified
8. **Log Events**: Comprehensive combat log messages for all actions

#### Target Resolution
Supports all target types from `types/ability.ts`:
- `self` - Actor themselves
- `single-ally` - One ally (player or enemy team)
- `single-enemy` - One enemy (opposing team)
- `all-allies` / `aoe-allies` - All allies
- `all-enemies` / `aoe-enemies` - All enemies

### 5. Combat Logging System
**Status**: âœ… Complete

#### Log Entry Types
- `turn-start` - Round/turn begins
- `ability-use` - Ability used (with AP cost)
- `damage` - Damage dealt (with crit indicator)
- `healing` - HP restored
- `status-applied` - Status effect applied
- `status-expired` - Status effect expired
- `death` - Combatant defeated
- `team-swap` - Reserve team swaps in
- `victory` - Battle won
- `defeat` - Battle lost

#### Log Functions
- `addCombatLog()` - Add entry with timestamp
- `getCurrentTurnLog()` - Filter by current turn
- `getRecentLog()` - Get last N entries

### 6. Team Management
**Status**: âœ… Complete

#### Reserve System
- **Team Wipe Detection**: When all active player characters die
- **Reserve Swap**: Offer to swap in reserve team at start of next round
- **Accept Defeat**: Player can choose to end battle instead
- **HP/AP Preservation**: Reserve characters retain current HP/AP state

#### Battle End Conditions
- **Victory**: All enemies defeated â†’ phase = 'victory'
- **Defeat**: All characters (active + reserve) dead â†’ phase = 'defeat'
- **Team Wipe**: Active team dead, reserve available â†’ phase = 'team-wipe'

## ðŸš§ Phase 6 Remaining Work (15%)

### What's Missing from Combat Engine

#### 1. XP/Reward Integration (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Problem**: Combat detects victory but doesn't award rewards

**What exists but isn't used**:
- âœ… `awardXp()` function in `systems/character.ts` (fully implemented)
- âœ… `generateEquipment()` function in `systems/equipment.ts`
- âœ… `calculateXpForLevel()` formula in `utils/formulas.ts`
- âœ… `state.xpEarned` and `state.lootDropped` fields defined in types

**What needs to be implemented**:
```typescript
// In systems/combat.ts or new systems/rewards.ts

function calculateBattleXp(enemies: Enemy[]): number {
  // Calculate XP based on enemy levels
  // Formula: sum of (enemyLevel * baseXP) for all defeated enemies
}

function distributeBattleXp(
  characters: Character[], 
  totalXp: number
): LevelUpResult[] {
  // Award XP equally to all 6 characters (active + reserve)
  // Return array of level-up notifications
}

function generateBattleLoot(enemies: Enemy[]): Equipment[] {
  // For each defeated enemy, max 1 equipment drop (can be 0)
  // Use generateEquipment() from equipment system
}
```

**Integration point**:
```typescript
// In checkBattleEnd() function when victory detected:
if (allEnemiesDead && !state.victory) {
  state.phase = 'victory';
  state.victory = true;
  
  // ADD THESE:
  const xpEarned = calculateBattleXp(state.enemyTeam);
  const levelUps = distributeBattleXp(state.playerTeam, xpEarned);
  const loot = generateBattleLoot(state.enemyTeam);
  
  state.xpEarned = xpEarned;
  state.lootDropped = loot;
  state.levelUps = levelUps; // Need to add this to CombatState type
  
  addCombatLog(state, {
    type: 'system',
    message: `Victory! Earned ${xpEarned} XP and ${loot.length} items.`,
  });
}
```

#### 2. Battle Results Summary (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**What's needed**:
- Function to create post-battle summary
- Level-up notification formatting
- Reward display preparation
- Statistics tracking (damage dealt, healing done, etc.)

#### 3. Testing & Validation (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**What's needed**:
- Demo battles to test full combat flow
- Test scenarios for edge cases
- Integration tests for reward distribution

### Completion Criteria
Phase 6 will be 100% complete when:
- âœ… XP calculation function implemented
- âœ… XP distribution integrated with combat victory
- âœ… Equipment drops integrated with combat victory
- âœ… `state.xpEarned` and `state.lootDropped` populated
- âœ… Level-up notifications working
- âœ… At least one test battle runs from start to rewards

**Estimated remaining time**: 1-2 hours
