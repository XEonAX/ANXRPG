# Session Summary - October 23, 2025 (Evening)

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Focus**: Recruitment System, Team Management Enhancements, Bug Fixes

## Overview

This session added major new features to complete the character progression loop and fixed several critical bugs that were blocking gameplay.

## Major Features Added

### 1. Recruitment System UI (236 lines)
**Problem**: User had 97 victories but only 1 character - no way to recruit new team members.

**Solution**: Complete recruitment screen showing all 6 character types.

**Features**:
- Automatic trigger after victories at milestones (20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
- Character type cards with full details:
  - Base stats at level 1 (HP, ATK, DEF, MAG, RES, SPD, CRT, EVA, ACC)
  - AP regeneration rate
  - Role and description
  - Traits (abilities, special features)
- Color-coded borders matching character type
- Responsive grid layout
- Auto-save after recruitment
- Seamless integration with battle results flow

**Files**:
- `src/ui/RecruitmentScreen.ts` (NEW - 236 lines)
- `src/style.css` (+217 lines for recruitment styles)
- `src/ui/BattleResultsScreen.ts` (modified to check recruitment eligibility)
- `src/ui/core/ScreenManager.ts` (added 'recruitment' screen type)
- `src/main.ts` (registered recruitment screen)

### 2. Drag-and-Drop Team Management (185 lines)
**Problem**: Team management required clicking multiple buttons to organize characters.

**Solution**: Full drag-and-drop system for intuitive character organization.

**Features**:
- **Reorder within teams**: Drag characters in Active Team to set turn order
- **Swap between teams**: Drag Active ↔ Reserve
- **Assign from roster**: Drag unassigned characters to teams
- **Visual feedback**:
  - Dragging card becomes 40% transparent
  - Drop zones glow blue with pulse animation
  - Compact drag preview (name, type, level)
  - Color-coded preview border
- **Smart detection**: Detects if roster characters are already assigned
- **Multiple drop behaviors**:
  - Drop on character → swap/reorder
  - Drop on empty slot → assign to position
  - Drop on grid → add to end

**Files**:
- `src/ui/TeamManagementScreen.ts` (+185 lines)
- `src/style.css` (+45 lines for drag states)

### 3. Team Assignment Buttons (40 lines)
**Problem**: Unassigned characters had no way to join teams.

**Solution**: Added assignment buttons for unassigned characters.

**Features**:
- Shows "To Active" / "To Reserve" buttons for unassigned characters
- Validates team capacity (max 3 per team)
- Success notifications
- Fallback for users who prefer buttons over drag-and-drop

## Critical Bug Fixes

### Bug #1: Team Wipe Dialog Duplicates
**Problem**: Multiple "Team Wiped!" dialogs stacking at bottom of screen.

**Root Cause**: Dialog appended to body every time screen re-rendered (multiple times).

**Solution**:
- Check for existing dialog before creating new one
- Use proper modal structure with overlay wrapper
- Modal now centers on screen with backdrop
- Only shows once per team wipe

**Impact**: Game-breaking bug fixed - players can now properly swap reserve team.

### Bug #2: Incorrect Reserve Character Count
**Problem**: Dialog showed "3 reserve characters" when only 2 were alive.

**Solution**:
- Filter reserve team to count only alive characters
- `combat.reserveTeam.filter(c => c.isAlive).length`
- Proper pluralization

### Bug #3: Character Duplication from Roster
**Problem**: Dragging characters from Full Roster duplicated them.

**Root Cause**: 
- Full Roster shows all 6 characters (including assigned ones)
- Drag code treated all roster drags as "unassigned"
- Characters added to new team without removing from old

**Solution**:
- Check if character is already assigned to a team
- If assigned: Move between teams (remove from old, add to new)
- If unassigned: Add to team
- No more duplication!

### Bug #4: Combat Stuck "Unable to Act"
**Problem**: All characters showing "unable to act!" at battle start - game completely stuck.

**Root Cause**: 
- Status effects from previous battles persisting
- Control effects (Stun, Sleep, Freeze) preventing all actions
- No clearing mechanism between battles

**Solution**:
- Clear all status effects when starting new battle
- Added `character.statusEffects = []` in `handleStageSelect()`
- Fresh start for every combat encounter

**Impact**: Game-breaking bug fixed - combat now works properly.

### Bug #5: Oversized Drag Preview
**Problem**: Drag preview showed full character card (too large, cluttered).

**Solution**:
- Created compact custom drag preview
- Shows: Character name (bold) + Type and Level (smaller)
- ~200px wide with color-coded border
- Positioned near cursor

## User Experience Improvements

### Before This Session

- ✅ Single centered modal on defeat
- ✅ Accurate reserve count
- ✅ No duplication bugs
- ✅ Combat works perfectly

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
✅ Win 20 battles → recruitment screen appears  
✅ Recruit character → added to roster  
✅ Drag character to reorder → turn order changes  
✅ Drag between teams → character moves  
✅ Drag from roster → assigns or moves correctly  
✅ Team wipe → single modal, correct count  
✅ Start new battle → status effects cleared  
✅ Drag preview → compact and readable  

### Edge Cases Tested
✅ Dragging to full team → warning notification  
✅ Dragging character to same team → appropriate feedback  
✅ Multiple team wipes → no duplicate modals  
✅ Status effects in reserve team → cleared on battle start  
✅ Dragging assigned character from roster → moves correctly  

## What's Next

### Immediate Priorities
- Player testing and feedback
- Balance adjustments if needed
- Performance optimization

### Phase 12 Completion
The recruitment system was actually a missing feature from Phase 8 (Progression). With this addition:
- ✅ All core game systems complete
- ✅ All UI screens functional
- ✅ Zero critical bugs
- ✅ Game fully playable start to finish

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Touch support for drag-and-drop
- Multi-select for batch operations
- Keyboard shortcuts for reordering
- Retirement UI (for 6th recruitment at 100 victories)
- Undo/redo for team changes

## Conclusion

This was a highly productive session that:
1. **Completed missing feature**: Recruitment system (should have been in Phase 8)
2. **Major UX improvement**: Drag-and-drop team management
3. **Fixed 5 critical bugs**: Team wipe, character duplication, status effects, counts, drag preview
4. **Improved polish**: Better user feedback, cleaner interactions

**The game is now in excellent shape** with all core systems working correctly and an intuitive UI for all major interactions.
