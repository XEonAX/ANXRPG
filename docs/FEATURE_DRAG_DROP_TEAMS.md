# Drag-and-Drop Team Management

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Feature**: Full drag-and-drop interface for team management

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive drag-and-drop system for the Team Management screen that allows intuitive character organization with visual feedback.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Drag-and-Drop Operations**

#### Reordering Within Teams
- Drag characters within the **Active Team** to change turn order
- Drag characters within the **Reserve Team** to organize
- Visual reordering as you drag over other characters

#### Moving Between Teams
- Drag from **Active → Reserve** and vice versa
- Drag unassigned characters from **Roster → Active/Reserve**
- Smart swapping when dropping on occupied slots

#### Smart Drop Behavior
- **Drop on character**: Swap positions or reorder
- **Drop on empty slot**: Assign to that position
- **Drop on empty grid space**: Add to end of team

### 2. **Visual Feedback**

#### During Drag
```css
.character-card.dragging {
  opacity: 0.4;
  transform: scale(0.95);
  cursor: grabbing;
}
```
- Card becomes semi-transparent
- Slightly scaled down
- Cursor changes to grabbing hand

#### Drop Zones
```css
.character-card.drop-target {
  border-color: #3b82f6;
  box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.5);
  animation: pulse-drop-zone 1.5s infinite;
}
```
- Blue pulsing glow when hovering over valid drop target
- Animated pulse effect to draw attention
- Clear visual indication of where character will land

#### Custom Drag Image
- Creates a rotated ghost image of the card
- Follows cursor during drag operation
- 80% opacity with 3-degree rotation

### 3. **Drag Logic Implementation**

#### Case 1: Reordering Within Same Team
```typescript
// Maintain turn order in Active Team
sourceTeamIds.splice(draggedIndex, 1);
sourceTeamIds.splice(newTargetIndex, 0, draggedCharId);
```

#### Case 2: Assigning from Roster
```typescript
// Unassigned → Active/Reserve
if (targetTeamIds.length < 3) {
  targetTeamIds.push(draggedCharId);
}
```

#### Case 3: Swapping Between Teams
```typescript
// Active ↔ Reserve swap
sourceTeamIds[sourceIndex] = targetCharId;
targetTeamIds[targetIndex] = draggedCharId;
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. TeamManagementScreen.ts (+140 lines)

**Character Card Drag Handlers**:
```typescript
card.setAttribute('draggable', 'true');
card.addEventListener('dragstart', ...);
card.addEventListener('dragend', ...);
card.addEventListener('dragover', ...);
card.addEventListener('drop', ...);
```

**New Functions**:
- `setupDropZone(grid, targetLocation, uiState)` - Makes team grids drop-enabled
- `handleDrop(draggedCharId, sourceLocation, targetLocation, targetCharId, uiState)` - Central drop logic
- Updated `renderEmptySlot()` - Now accepts drops
- Updated `renderActiveTeamSection()` - Maintains character order
- Updated `renderReserveTeamSection()` - Maintains character order

#### 2. style.css (+45 lines)

**Drag States**:
- `.character-card[draggable="true"]` - Grabbable cursor
- `.character-card.dragging` - Semi-transparent while dragging
- `.character-card.drop-target` - Glowing pulse animation
- `@keyframes pulse-drop-zone` - Pulsing effect

### Drop Logic Flow

```
User Drags Character
  ↓
dragstart → Store character ID in dataTransfer
  ↓
dragover (on drop target) → Show visual feedback
  ↓
drop → handleDrop() with 3 cases:
  ├─ Same team → Reorder
  ├─ Roster → Team → Assign
  └─ Team → Team → Swap/Move
  ↓
Update team arrays → Refresh screen
```

## User Experience

### Drag from Active Team
1. **Grab** any character in Active Team (cursor: grab)
2. **Drag** over another Active character → see blue glow
3. **Drop** → characters swap positions (turn order updated!)

### Drag from Reserve Team
1. **Grab** Reserve character
2. **Drag** to Active Team → see valid drop zones glow
3. **Drop** on Active character → swap between teams
4. **Drop** on empty slot → move to Active Team

### Drag from Roster (Unassigned)
1. **Grab** unassigned character
2. **Drag** to Active or Reserve → valid slots glow
3. **Drop** → character assigned to that team

### Visual States
- **Idle**: Card has grab cursor on hover
- **Dragging**: Original card fades out (40% opacity)
- **Drop Target**: Target glows blue with pulse animation
- **Success**: Notification shows what happened

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Full Team**: Shows warning notification if team has 3 characters
2. **Drop on Self**: Ignored (no-op)
3. **Invalid Source**: Safely returns if character not found
4. **Maintain Order**: Active/Reserve teams preserve character order in arrays
5. **Stop Propagation**: Card drops don't bubble to parent grid

## Advantages Over Button-Based System

### Before (Buttons)
- Click "To Reserve" → character moves to end of reserve
- Click "To Active" → character moves to end of active
- No control over position
- Multiple clicks needed for specific ordering

### After (Drag-and-Drop)
- **Visual**: See exactly where character will go
- **Fast**: Single drag operation replaces multiple clicks
- **Precise**: Drop at specific position for turn order
- **Intuitive**: Natural interaction model
- **Flexible**: Swap, reorder, or assign in one motion

## Browser Compatibility

Uses standard HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ⚠️ Touch devices: May need polyfill (future enhancement)

## Performance Considerations

- No performance impact: Native browser API
- Minimal re-renders: Only updates on drop
- Efficient: Directly manipulates team ID arrays
- No memory leaks: Event listeners on elements that get cleaned up

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Touch Support**: Add touch event handlers for mobile
2. **Undo/Redo**: Keep history of team changes
3. **Drag Preview**: Show character stats in drag image
4. **Multi-Select**: Drag multiple characters at once
5. **Keyboard Support**: Arrow keys for reordering (accessibility)

## Testing Checklist
