## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Import Statements
**Problem**: Initial imports used wrong types (`UIState` vs `UIGameState`)  
**Solution**: Updated to use `ScreenContext` pattern like other screens  
**Files**: SettingsScreen.ts (imports fixed)

### Issue 2: ScreenManager getInstance()
**Problem**: Used non-existent `getInstance()` method  
**Solution**: Changed to direct `ScreenManager.navigateTo()` calls  
**Files**: SettingsScreen.ts (3 occurrences fixed)

### Issue 3: Settings Without Save
**Problem**: Settings screen requires uiState but Main Menu might not have save  
**Solution**: Added fallback logic to create temporary default state  
**Files**: MainMenuScreen.ts (Settings button handler)
