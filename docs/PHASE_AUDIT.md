- ✅ `getRecentLog()` - Recent messages

**Victory/Defeat Detection**:
- ✅ `checkBattleEnd()` - Detects victory, defeat, team wipe
- ✅ Sets `state.phase` to 'victory', 'defeat', or 'team-wipe'
- ✅ Sets `state.victory` boolean

#### ❌ What is NOT Implemented

**Missing: XP/Reward Calculation**
- ❌ Function to calculate XP based on enemy levels
- ❌ Function to distribute XP to all 6 characters (active + reserve)
- ❌ Integration of `awardXp()` with combat victory
- ❌ Populating `state.xpEarned` field

**Missing: Equipment Drops**
- ❌ Function to generate equipment drops (max 1 per enemy, can be 0)
- ❌ Drop chance calculation
- ❌ Populating `state.lootDropped` field

**Missing: Battle Results**
- ❌ Function to create battle results summary
- ❌ Level-up notifications from combat
- ❌ Reward display preparation

**Missing: Testing**
- ❌ Combat test scenarios
- ❌ Demo battles
- ❌ Integration tests

#### What Exists But Isn't Used
- ⚠️ `state.xpEarned` - Defined in type but never populated
- ⚠️ `state.lootDropped` - Defined in type but never populated
- ⚠️ `awardXp()` exists in character system but not called from combat

**Verdict**: 85% COMPLETE - Core combat functional, rewards system not integrated

**Note**: The combat engine is **fully functional for battles** (can fight from start to victory/defeat), but the **progression/reward integration** is missing. This is acceptable as rewards naturally belong in Phase 8 (Progression System) when integrated with the full game loop.

---

### ❌ Phase 7: Enemy System - **NOT STARTED**
- ❌ No enemy data files
- ❌ No enemy generation functions
- ❌ No boss mechanics
- ❌ No enemy AI

**Verdict**: NOT STARTED

---

### ❌ Phase 8: Progression System - **PARTIAL** (awardXp function exists, not integrated)
- ✅ `awardXp()` function implemented in character system
- ✅ XP formula (`calculateXpForLevel()`) exists
- ❌ Skill tree system not implemented
- ❌ Character recruitment system not implemented
- ❌ Battle victory counter not implemented

**Verdict**: 10% COMPLETE (XP function only)

---

### ❌ Phase 9-14: NOT STARTED
- ❌ Campaign system
- ❌ Save system
- ❌ UI implementation
- ❌ Game juice
- ❌ Balance & testing
- ❌ Final polish

---

## Summary

### Accurate Phase Completion

|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Foundation | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% |
| 2. Character System | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% |
| 3. Ability System | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% |
| 4. Equipment System | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% |
| 5. Status Effects | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% |
| 6. Combat Engine | 🟡 FUNCTIONAL | 85% |
| 7. Enemy System | ❌ NOT STARTED | 0% |
| 8. Progression | 🟡 PARTIAL | 10% |
| 9. Campaign | ❌ NOT STARTED | 0% |
| 10. Save System | ❌ NOT STARTED | 0% |
| 11. UI | ❌ NOT STARTED | 0% |
| 12. Game Juice | ❌ NOT STARTED | 0% |
| 13. Balance/Testing | ❌ NOT STARTED | 0% |
| 14. Polish | ❌ NOT STARTED | 0% |

### Overall Project Completion
- **Phases Fully Complete**: 5/14 (36%)
- **Phases Partially Complete**: 2/14 (Combat 85%, Progression 10%)
- **Weighted Completion**: ~40% (accounting for partial phases)

### What Works Right Now
✅ Can create characters with all stats  
✅ Can equip items and calculate stats  
✅ Can apply status effects  
✅ Can execute combat from start to finish  
✅ Can detect victory/defeat  
✅ All damage formulas working  
✅ Turn-based combat flow working  
✅ Multi-action system working  
✅ Reserve swap working  

### What Doesn't Work
❌ No enemies to fight (need Phase 7)  
❌ No XP awarded on victory (integration missing)  
❌ No equipment drops (integration missing)  
❌ No skill trees (need Phase 8)  
❌ No campaign/stages (need Phase 9)  
❌ No save/load (need Phase 10)  
❌ No UI (need Phase 11)  

### Critical Path Forward
1. **Phase 6 Completion** (1-2 hours): Add XP/equipment reward functions
2. **Phase 7** (3-4 hours): Enemy system so we have something to fight
3. **Phase 8** (4-5 hours): Progression system for skill trees and recruitment
4. **Phase 9-14**: Campaign, Save, UI, Polish

**Audit Completed**: October 22, 2025  
**Auditor**: AI Code Review  
**Conclusion**: Documentation was ~7% optimistic. Core systems solid, integration gaps exist.
