**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Session Focus**: Combat Screen + Battle Results  
**Status**: 7/10 Screens Complete (70% of Phase 11)

## What Was Built This Session

### Combat Screen (570 lines)
**File**: `src/ui/CombatScreen.ts`

   - Character cards with name, type, level
   - HP bars with color coding (green → yellow → red)
   - AP display showing current/max AP
   - Status effect badges with duration and tooltips

5. **Ability Selection System**
   - Dynamic ability buttons (4-6 per character)
   - AP cost display on each button
   - Disabled state when insufficient AP
   - Tooltips with ability details
   - Target type handling:
     - `self` → targets self
     - `single-ally` → targets ally (first for now)
     - `single-enemy` → targets first enemy
     - `all-allies`, `aoe-allies` → all player characters
     - `all-enemies`, `aoe-enemies` → all enemies

6. **Multi-Action Support**
   - "End Turn" button
   - Ability execution updates combat state
   - Re-renders screen after each action
   - AP tracking across multiple actions
   - Turn progression

7. **Enemy AI**
   - Auto-processes enemy turns after 1s delay
   - Random ability selection
   - Random target selection
   - Respects AP costs
   - Auto-advances to next combatant

8. **Combat Log**
   - Scrolling message history (last 20 entries)
   - Color-coded message types:
     - Turn start (gray background)
     - Ability use (blue background)
     - Damage (red background and text)
     - Healing (green background and text)

10. **Reserve Swap Dialog**
    - Triggers when active team wiped (`team-wipe` phase)
    - Modal with two options:
      - "Swap to Reserve" → continues fight
      - "Accept Defeat" → ends combat
    - Shows reserve character count
    - Updates combat state accordingly

**Integration with Combat System**:
- Uses `startCombat()` on initial render
- Calls `getCurrentCombatant()` for turn management
- Executes abilities via `executeAbility(state, abilityId, targetIds)`
- Advances turns with `endTurn()`
- Displays log with `getRecentLog()`
- Handles reserve swap with `swapReserveTeam()` / `acceptDefeat()`

   - Current level display for each character
   - Note: "All characters gain equal XP" as per game design

3. **Equipment Loot Section**

   - Rarity-based color coding:

- `.battle-results__characters` - XP grid
- `.battle-results__loot` - Equipment list
- `.battle-results__loot-item` - Individual items with rarity colors
- Animations: `slideDown`, `fadeIn` with staggered delays

## Technical Decisions

### Type Safety Challenges Solved
1. **Character HP Tracking**
   - Character uses `stats.hp` (not `currentHp`)
   - Enemy uses `stats.hp` as well
   - This is consistent across both types

2. **Ability Target Types**
   - Fixed target type strings to match `TargetType` union
   - Changed `'ally'` → `'single-ally'`
   - Changed `'aoe'` → `'all-enemies'` or `'aoe-enemies'`
   - Changed `'single'` → `'single-enemy'`

3. **executeAbility Signature**
   - Signature is `(state, abilityId, targetIds)`
   - Does NOT need actor ID - gets current combatant automatically
   - This simplifies UI code

4. **completeStage Parameters**
   - Requires 5 parameters: `(progress, stageNumber, victory, xpEarned, lootDropped)`
   - Victory flag is boolean
   - XP and loot come from combat state

### UI/UX Patterns Established

1. **Real-time State Updates**
   - Combat state is mutable
   - After each action, call `ScreenManager.updateContext()` to re-render
   - This pattern works well for turn-based combat

2. **Enemy Turn Delay**
   - 1 second delay before processing enemy turn
   - Gives player time to see what happened
   - Makes combat feel less instant/robotic

3. **Combat Log Scroll**
   - Auto-scrolls to bottom after render
   - Uses `setTimeout(..., 0)` to wait for DOM update
   - Shows last 20 messages to prevent overflow

4. **Modal Dialogs**
   - Reserve swap uses modal appended to `document.body`
   - Manually removed when buttons clicked
   - This pattern can be reused for other dialogs

## Integration Status

### Working Flows (Now Fully Testable!)
✅ **Main Menu → New Game → Team → Campaign → Combat → Results**:
1. Main Menu: Create character
2. Team Management: View team
3. Campaign Map: Select Stage 1
4. Combat Screen: Fight enemies with abilities
5. Victory: See XP and loot
6. Return to Campaign: Stage 1 marked complete, Stage 2 unlocked

✅ **Combat Multi-Action**:
1. Select ability → executes → updates display
2. Can select another ability if AP available
3. Click "End Turn" → next combatant acts
4. Enemy turns auto-process
5. Round progresses until victory/defeat

✅ **Reserve Swap**:
1. Active team defeated
2. Modal appears
3. Choose "Swap to Reserve" or "Accept Defeat"
4. Combat continues or ends

✅ **Save/Load Cycle**:
1. Win battle → auto-saves
2. Refresh page
3. Click "Continue"
4. Campaign Map shows stage completed
5. Next stage unlocked

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No Target Selection UI**
   - Single-target abilities always hit first enemy
   - Single-ally abilities target first ally
   - Could add clickable character cards for targeting

2. **No Level-Up Display**
   - Characters level up during combat (via combat system)
   - Battle Results doesn't show which chars leveled
   - Could track level-ups in combat state

3. **Simplified Enemy AI**
   - Just picks random ability and random target
   - No strategy (e.g., healing when low HP)
   - Could add behavior patterns

4. **No Ability Animations**
   - Just instant damage/healing numbers
   - Could add visual effects (particles, screen shake)
   - Combat log provides text feedback for now

5. **No Boss Summon Visual**
   - Boss summons minions automatically (combat system handles it)
   - UI doesn't show special animation/message
   - Just appears in combat log

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Target Selection**
   - Click enemy card to target them
   - Highlight valid targets based on ability
   - Confirmation before executing

2. **Ability Preview**
   - Show damage estimate before using
   - Show healing estimate
   - Display hit chance

3. **Turn Order Display**
   - Show upcoming turn order (next 3-5 combatants)
   - Based on speed stat

4. **Combat Speed Controls**
   - Auto-battle mode
   - Fast-forward enemy turns
   - Pause/resume

5. **Better Status Effect Display**
   - Icons instead of text badges
   - Tooltips with full descriptions
   - Duration countdown animation
