# Bug Fix: Combat Log Scrollbar Not Appearing

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Severity**: Medium (UX Issue)  
**Version**: 1.6.2

## Problem

The combat log scrollbar was not appearing even when there were many messages exceeding the container height. Users couldn't scroll to see earlier combat messages.

## Root Cause

The CSS for `.combat-log__messages` had conflicting flex properties:

```css
.combat-log__messages {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-end;  /* ❌ Problem #1 */
  gap: var(--space-xs);
  height: 100%;               /* ❌ Problem #2 */
  overflow-y: auto;
  flex: 1;
  padding-right: var(--space-xs);
}
```

### Why This Broke Scrolling

1. **`justify-content: flex-end`** - This property tries to push all content to the bottom of the flex container. When combined with `overflow-y: auto`, it creates a conflict where the browser doesn't properly calculate when scrolling is needed.

2. **`height: 100%`** - This was redundant with `flex: 1` and could cause sizing issues in some browsers.

3. **Missing `min-height: 0`** - Flex children need this to properly respect overflow in certain browsers (especially older versions).

## Solution

Fixed the CSS by removing conflicting properties and adding the critical `min-height`:

```css
.combat-log__messages {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: var(--space-xs);
  overflow-y: auto;
  flex: 1;
  padding-right: var(--space-xs);
  min-height: 0; /* ✅ Critical for flex child scrolling */
}
```

### Changes Made

1. ✅ **Removed `justify-content: flex-end`** - Let JavaScript handle bottom positioning
2. ✅ **Removed `height: 100%`** - Already using `flex: 1`
3. ✅ **Added `min-height: 0`** - Enables proper scrolling in flex containers

### Why This Works

- The JavaScript already auto-scrolls to the bottom:
  ```javascript
  setTimeout(() => {
    messages.scrollTop = messages.scrollHeight;
  }, 0);
  ```
- No need for CSS to position items at bottom
- Browser can now properly detect when content exceeds container height
- Scrollbar appears and functions correctly

## Testing

### Before Fix
- ❌ Scrollbar doesn't appear
- ❌ Can't see earlier messages
- ❌ Messages appear cut off

### After Fix
- ✅ Scrollbar appears when messages exceed 200px height
- ✅ Can scroll to see all messages
- ✅ Still auto-scrolls to latest message
- ✅ Custom scrollbar styling works

### Test Cases

1. **Few Messages** (< 200px height)
   - ✅ No scrollbar (not needed)
   - ✅ Messages visible
   - ✅ Auto-scroll works

2. **Many Messages** (> 200px height)
   - ✅ Scrollbar appears
   - ✅ Can scroll up/down
   - ✅ Auto-scrolls to bottom on new message
   - ✅ Scrollbar styled correctly (blue thumb)

3. **Long Battle** (50+ messages)
   - ✅ All messages accessible
   - ✅ Smooth scrolling
   - ✅ No performance issues

## Technical Details

### The `min-height: 0` Fix

This is a well-known CSS gotcha with flexbox. By default, flex items have `min-height: auto`, which means they won't shrink below their content size. This prevents `overflow` from working properly.

**MDN Documentation**:
> "To make overflow work on flex items, you need to set min-height: 0 or min-width: 0"

### Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Before Fix | After Fix |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Chrome 90+ | ❌ Broken | ✅ Works |
| Firefox 88+ | ❌ Broken | ✅ Works |
| Safari 14+ | ❌ Broken | ✅ Works |
| Edge 90+ | ❌ Broken | ✅ Works |

## Related Issues

This fix also benefits the mobile responsive design since the same scrolling mechanism is used at all breakpoints:
- Desktop: 200px height
- Mobile: 120px height
- Small mobile: 100px height

## Files Modified

- `src/style.css` - Fixed `.combat-log__messages` CSS

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Remember the flexbox scrolling rule**: Always add `min-height: 0` or `min-width: 0` to flex children that need to scroll
2. **Avoid `justify-content` with `overflow`**: These properties often conflict
3. **Test scrolling early**: Check if scrollbars appear during development
4. **Use browser DevTools**: Inspect computed styles to catch conflicts
