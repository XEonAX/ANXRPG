- **UI**: Pure semantic HTML (no frameworks)
- **Styling**: Minimal CSS
- **Storage**: Browser LocalStorage
- **Deployment**: Static site (GitHub Pages/Netlify ready)

## üìã Current Status
**Phase**: Active Development - 5/14 Complete, 2 Partial (~45% Overall)

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Project Foundation (Types & Structure)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Character System (6 character types, including `awardXp()`)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Ability System (24 abilities defined)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Equipment System (8 slots, 7 rarity tiers)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5**: Status Effects System (26 effects, stacking, DOT/HOT)
- üü° **Phase 6**: Combat Engine (85% - core functional, missing reward integration)
- ÔøΩ **Phase 7**: Enemy System (75% - templates + generation done, needs testing)
- üü° **Phase 8**: Progression (10% - `awardXp` exists, not integrated)

**Next Steps**: 
1. Complete Phase 6 rewards (integrate XP/equipment drops into combat victory)
2. Test Phase 7 enemy system (create demo battles, verify boss summons)
3. Build comprehensive combat test suite

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands
```bash
npm install         # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start Vite dev server
npm run build       # Production build
npm run preview     # Preview production build
npm run type-check  # TypeScript type checking

## üé≤ Core Mechanics Highlights

### Action Point (AP) System
- Base 3 AP/turn + character-specific regeneration (3-6 AP)
- Max 10 AP pool
- Abilities cost 1-4 AP typically
- Multi-action: use multiple abilities per turn

### Combat Formula
```typescript
Physical: (ATK * multiplier) - (DEF * 0.5)
Magical:  (MAG * multiplier) - (RES * 0.5)
Critical: 2x damage multiplier
Hit/Miss: clamp(ACC - (EVA * 0.5), 5, 95)
```

### Character Progression
- Equal XP to all 6 characters (active + reserve)
- 1 skill point per level for ~20-node skill trees
- Equipment drops at stage level, requires matching character level
- New character recruitment every 20 victories

## üìä Implementation Progress

### Completed Systems (Phase 8 - v0.8.0)
- **Type Definitions**: 7 core modules + skill tree types
- **Character Types**: All 6 types with balanced stats and growth rates
- **Abilities**: 24 player abilities + 40+ enemy abilities
- **Equipment System**: 8 slots, 7 rarity tiers, procedural generation
- **Status Effects**: 26 effects with stacking, DOT/HOT, control
- **Combat Engine**: Turn-based multi-action with full reward integration
- **Enemy System**: 28 templates (21 regular + 7 bosses), boss summons

- **Utilities**: RNG, formula library, ID generation

### Skill Tree System (Phase 8)
- **120 Total Nodes**: ~20 nodes per character type (14 stat nodes, 2-3 ability slot unlocks, 3-4 multi-point nodes)
- **Linear Progression**: Prerequisite system ensures logical unlock order
- **Node Types**: Stat bonuses (HP, ATK, DEF, etc.), ability slot unlocks (5th/6th), multi-point investments
