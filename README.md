## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands
```bash
npm install         # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start Vite dev server
npm run build       # Production build
npm run preview     # Preview production build
npm run type-check  # TypeScript type checking
```

## üé≤ Core Mechanics Highlights

### Action Point (AP) System
- Base 3 AP/turn + character-specific regeneration (3-6 AP)
- Max 10 AP pool
- Abilities cost 1-4 AP typically
- Multi-action: use multiple abilities per turn

### Combat Formula
```typescript
Physical: (ATK * multiplier) - (DEF * 0.5)
Magical:  (MAG * multiplier) - (RES * 0.5)
Critical: 2x damage multiplier
Hit/Miss: clamp(ACC - (EVA * 0.5), 5, 95)
```

### Character Progression
- Equal XP to all 6 characters (active + reserve)
- 1 skill point per level for ~20-node skill trees
- Equipment drops at stage level, requires matching character level
- New character recruitment every 20 victories

## üìä Implementation Progress

### Completed Systems
- **Type Definitions**: Complete type system with 7 core modules (status, character, ability, equipment, enemy, combat, game)
- **Character Types**: All 6 character types with balanced base stats and growth rates
- **Abilities**: 24 abilities (4 per character type) with varied effects and targeting
- **Equipment System**: 8 equipment slots, 7 rarity tiers, procedural generation with level scaling
- **Formulas**: Damage calculation, stat scaling, XP curves, hit/miss mechanics
- **Utilities**: RNG system, formula library, ID generation

### Equipment System Features
- **8 Slots**: Main Hand, Off Hand, Head, Chest, Legs, Neck, Wrist√ó2
- **7 Rarity Tiers**: Basic, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic
- **Level Requirements**: Equipment drops at stage level, requires matching character level
- **Stat Bonuses**: Dynamic scaling (base value + level √ó growth rate √ó rarity multiplier)
- **Procedural Names**: "Mythic Worldbreaker Greatsword", "Rare Enchanted Amulet", etc.
- **Dual-Weapon Support**: Two-handed weapons occupy both hand slots

### Character Types Implemented
| Type | Role | HP (Lv1) | AP/Turn | Key Stats |
|------|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Alpha (Paladin) | Tank/Healer | 120 | +3 | High DEF, Medium ATK |
| Beta (Rogue) | Crit DPS | 70 | +6 | High SPD/CRT, Low DEF |
| Gamma (Mage) | AoE Caster | 60 | +4 | High MAG/RES, Low HP |
| Delta (Warrior) | Physical DPS | 100 | +4 | High ATK, Medium DEF |
| Epsilon (Cleric) | Healer/Support | 80 | +5 | High MAG/RES, Balanced |
| Zeta (Berserker) | High Risk DPS | 90 | +5 | Very High ATK, Low DEF |
