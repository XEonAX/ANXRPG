**Next Steps**: 
1. Phase 11: UI implementation (semantic HTML screens)
2. Phase 12: Game juice (flavor text, polish)
3. Phase 13+: Balance, testing, final polish

### Combat Formula
```typescript
Physical: (ATK * multiplier) - (DEF * 0.5)
Magical:  (MAG * multiplier) - (RES * 0.5)
Critical: 2x damage multiplier
Hit/Miss: clamp(ACC - (EVA * 0.5), 5, 95)
```

### Character Progression
- Equal XP to all 6 characters (active + reserve)
- 1 skill point per level for ~20-node skill trees
- Equipment drops at stage level, requires matching character level
