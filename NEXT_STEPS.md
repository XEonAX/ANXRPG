## 🎯 Immediate Priorities

### 1. Start Phase 10: Save/Load System
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 sessions (4-6 hours)

**Goal**: Implement LocalStorage persistence for game state

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create save data type definitions
  - **File**: `src/types/save.ts`
  - Define serializable game state structure
  - Include character roster, campaign progress, equipment inventory
  
- [ ] Implement serialization functions
  - **File**: `src/utils/storage.ts`
  - Save game state to LocalStorage
  - Load game state from LocalStorage
  - Validate save data structure
  
- [ ] Add auto-save triggers
  - **Files**: `src/systems/combat.ts`, `src/systems/campaign.ts`
  - Auto-save after battle victory
  - Auto-save after stage completion
  - Auto-save after equipment changes
  
- [ ] Create new game initialization
  - **File**: `src/systems/game.ts`
  - Initialize default game state
  - Create starting character roster
  - Set up initial campaign progress
  
- [ ] Add save data migration
  - Handle version updates
  - Validate save structure
  - Error handling for corrupted saves

#### Expected Deliverables:
- Complete save/load system using LocalStorage
- Auto-save on key events
- New game initialization
- Save data validation

## 🚀 Future Milestones

### Phase 11: UI Implementation (Next After Phase 10)
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 sessions (12-16 hours)

**Goal**: Create complete semantic HTML interface

#### Key Screens:
1. Main Menu (New Game, Load Game, Continue)
2. Team Management (Active + Reserve roster)
3. Character Sheet (Stats, Equipment, Skills, Abilities)
4. Equipment Inventory (Filter, Equip, Hide items)
5. Campaign Map (Stage selection, Progress)
6. Combat Screen (Turn-based UI, Action bar, Log)
7. Battle Results (Victory/Defeat, Rewards, Level-ups)

**Priority**: Combat screen first (most critical for gameplay)

### Phase 12: Game Juice (Polish)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 sessions

- Flavor text for abilities
- Combat message generation
- Visual feedback (CSS animations)
- Sound effects (optional)

---

### Phase 13: Balance & Testing
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 sessions

- Enemy difficulty tuning
- Ability balancing
- Equipment drop rates

- Playtesting feedback

---

### Phase 14: Final Polish
**Estimated Time**: 1 session

- Bug fixes
- Performance optimization

## 🎮 How to Test Current State

### 1. Build the Project
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Run Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open Browser Console
Press F12 in browser, then:

```javascript
// Test campaign system
campaignTests.runAll()

// Test combat with Phase 9 integration
combatDemo.all()

// Test skill trees
phase8Tests.runAll()
```

### 4. What to Look For
- ✅ 100 stages defined correctly
- ✅ Boss battles every 10th stage
- ✅ Victory tracking works
- ✅ Stage unlocking progression
- ✅ Reward calculation (XP, equipment, gold)
- ✅ Integration with recruitment system
- ✅ Enemy team generation

## 💡 Tips for Next Session

1. **Start with Phase 10**: Save/Load system is critical infrastructure
2. **Reference Existing Patterns**: Look at game state types for serialization structure
3. **Test Save/Load Cycle**: Create game → save → reload → verify state restored
4. **Check GAME_DESIGN.md**: For any save system requirements
5. **Build Often**: Run `npm run build` to catch TypeScript errors early

**Status**: Campaign system complete! Ready to implement persistent save system. 🚀
